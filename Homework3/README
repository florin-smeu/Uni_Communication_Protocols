				    DNS Client
			    =======================
	
	
	What is this? 
	-------------
	In this homework I implemented a DNS Client using the C language, based on 
the specifications of the RFC 1035. Serveral types of queries can be performed 
(A, MX, NS, CNAME, SOA, TXT and PTR). 
	The answers received from the servers are logged in a file named "dns.log". 
The content of this file imitates the output of the command "host -v -t type 
name". Also, the messages sent to the DNS servers are logged in a file named 
"message.log" (hexadecimal).

	How it works?
	-------------
	The transport protocol utilized is UDP and the port is 53 (decimal).
	The DNS servers' addresses are retrieved from a file named 
"dns_servers.conf" found in the same directory as the source code. 
Comment lines start with "#" and are ignored. If a server does not answer the 
query that has just been sent to it, then the next server is interrogated and 
so on, until the last server found in the configuration file.
	The DNS query transmitted via UDP consists of a header and a question 
section. The header's size is constant. The header contains, in short, 
information about the id of the query, whether it is a query or an answer, 
and how many queries are performed.
	The question section contains the domain name whose IP address is searched
(or the IP address whose domain name will be searched), and the type and class
of the query.
	After a DNS server has answered the query, it will be processed and 
relevant information written to the dns.log file. An answer consists of a 
header, a question, and zero or more resource records in the following 
sections: answer, authority and  additional. Also, it is very important to 
mention that data compression is used (see section 4.1.4 of RFC 1035). 
	What the program does is to retrieve the information found in all the 
resource records according to the RFC 1035. 

	How to use?	
	-----------
	A makefile that contains the following rules has been created:
		+ build - compiles the source code;
		+ run - runs the executable (arguments are www.google.com and A)
		+ clean - deletes the executable and the dns.log and message.log files;
	
	To run the executable, the first argument will be the domain name or 
an ip address, and the second argument the type of query. Note that for a 
reverse look-up (first argument an IP address), the second argument must always
be PTR.
	E.g. ./dnsclient www.google.com A
	     ./dnsclient yahoo.com MX
	     ./dnsclient 216.98.12.13 PTR
